  In the small room,  Hooray, an interactive installation, is installed on three walls with a video installed  on the fourth wall. There is one bright light source in the middle of the room  to make participants&rsquo; shadows for interacting with Hooray.&nbsp; In Hooray, 208 human figures in double rows  are initially standing up.&nbsp; When  participants approach Hooray, the figures individually bow.&nbsp; To  accomplish this effect, when the participants&rsquo; shadows block light sensors,  motors are activated that cause the figures to bow.&nbsp; In my video, I bow and try to keep smiling for  10 minutes while gradually getting tired of bowing.
<p>Hooray  represents a hierarchical (power) relationship in  society.&nbsp; When participants get closer to  Hooray, their shadows seem like overwhelming small-scaled human figures.&nbsp; Small-scaled human figures bow showing their  obedience to the participants.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think our society&rsquo;s so  called democracy is not really a democracy.&nbsp;  An individual&rsquo;s money, power, and reputation are still organized in a  hierarchy.&nbsp; We do not live any more in a  society, which is set up as a relationship of servant and master, such as a caste  or a slavery system.&nbsp; However, the  current system is sometimes subtly misguiding people through mass media,  policy, or laws because they opt to represent people who have power and  influence.&nbsp; At the same time, in my  video, an Asian Woman bows and keeps smiling for 10 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The video specifically represents Asian culture,  which expects woman to be nice and be submissive. &nbsp;Hooray represents a general concept of a hierarchical  society with the video showing a specific example of Asian culture as two works  in a set.</p>
<p>I would like to see the  audiences&rsquo; reactions that occur when they encounter hierarchies of different  societies and cultures.&nbsp; I assume that  they may feel uncomfortable, curious, or indifferent.&nbsp; My greatest hope is for my audience to  become aware of our society&rsquo;s issues and have a chance to think about it while  they appreciate and enjoy the artwork. <br />

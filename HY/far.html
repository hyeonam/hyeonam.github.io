In urbanized areas, we live in discord with nature. The more our lives are industrialized, the more disconnected we become from nature. FarmWear, a living wearable interface, is an alternative, creative design solution to this disconnection. FarmWear is about getting closer to nature not only by growing plants but also by wearing them to build empathy. In order to empower users, FarmWear engages them in the design process with a Do-It-Yourself (DIY), an open-source application for designing custom jewelry (farmwear.netlify.app) that serves as a wearable substrate for growing plants. Users can go to the FarmWear website, choose a basic type of jewelry such as a ring, bracelet, or necklace, manipulate parameters to change the form of the jewelry, download their 3D files, and then 3D print their customized wearable. After they grow plants from seeds embedded in FarmWear, they can harvest and eat the plants. FarmWear can be reused and replanted continuously. Based on interviews with 12 participants who tried the FarmWear prototypes for up to 2 weeks, FarmWear can demonstrate how living wearables can build strong physical and emotional connections with nature and help people become healthier, more positive and resilient. <br /><br />

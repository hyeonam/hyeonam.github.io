  <strong>Summary </strong><br />
  Dinner party provides a space where people meet and interact with Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jabberwocky&rdquo; inspired creatures hiding in the shadows.<br />
  At first glance, the single chair and place set for one, seemingly provides a solitary dinner; rather the interaction offers a communication between oneself and the imaginary creatures. Initially gathered under the shadow cast by the plate, disturbed creatures will nervously scatter, attempting to go around any other shadow cast on the table, while a period of quiet will encourage the creatures to reveal themselves.</li>

<li><strong>Personal Story</strong><br />
  Since I was 7 years old, I have had my friend. I call her &quot;Ling Ling&quot;. At that time, she was one of my hair bands, however I could talk to her every night. I wrote a diary to her and I felt she understood everything. Especially when my mom was angry at me, I talked to her more often. Also I made a bed and house for her in my drawer. When I closed my drawer, I guessed she was alive there. Terribly, one day I needed a hair band, I used her. :)
  <p>Anyway, now I don&rsquo;t have a special object. I just feel my friend. I can talk to her who hides next to desk or next to door. When I have a problem, I talk to her who totally understands me and supports me. I could talk simply to myself or I could talk to an imaginary creature. However, second option makes me feel much better. Some problem is too personal to talk to anyone or sometimes I am weary to repeat my terrible experience. However, my friend knew already. She is all the time there to listen to my story.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Interface</strong><br />
    How I can introduce my friend to audience? I do research about repetitious action or event in our daily life. Even we know their world or not, our meaningless action effects their world. I pick up the eating gesture to use and make dinner table as an interface. When we eat, even we intend to have communication or not, we have some interaction between imaginary creature and us. </p>
